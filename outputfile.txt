Just behind him.  Humanoid in design, but still 
     obviously a machine.  Metal and synthetic casings covering 

     hydraulic muscles.  The thing senses his stare.  Looks up 

     with a muted WHIR... 

 

                          ROBOT 

                    (metallic voice) 

                Good day, sir... 

 

     Spooner.  Speeds up his pace.  Weaving through the crowd to 

     lose the robot. 

 

     We now realise this is THE FUTURE.  Towering apartment  

     buildings block the sun.  The street packed with traffic. 

     PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting  

     portable offices.  Spooner throws a look at his surroundings: 

 

     Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building 

     cleaning windows. 

 

     A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently 

     repairs the street.  No human supervision. 

 

     A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW.  Lumbering along the sidewalk. 

     Scrubbing, sweeping.  Emptying trash... 

 

     Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd.  Following their owners. 

     Walking slowly, deliberately.  Carrying boxes.  Groceries. 

     Briefcases. 

 

     Stamped on all the ROBOTS™ SIDES, a LOGO:  
III LAWS SAFE
. 
 

     Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS. 

     Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father™s 

     neck.  She smiles big at Spooner.  Front teeth missing. 

 

                          LITTLE GIRL 

                Hi. 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

                          SPOONER 

                Hi. 

 

     But it™s not her father.  It™s her ROBOT CARETAKER.  The 

     robot turns.  Looks at the girl. 

 

                          ROBOT 

                You are not allowed to talk to 

                strangers. 

 

     Spooner, disgusted.  Has had enough.  He steps off the curb 

     Just as... 

 

     THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around.  Training its large  

     digital EYE on him: 

 

                          TRAFFIC LIGHT 

                Please return to the sidewalk. 

 

     Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street. 

 

                          TRAFFIC LIGHT 

                Please return to the sidewalk... 

 

     The traffic signal, tracking him. 

 

                          TRAFFIC LIGHT 

                You are in violation of city  

                ordinance 14-B726... 

 

     Spooner throws up his hand.  Flipping it the bird just as 

     SNAP!  It takes his picture.
